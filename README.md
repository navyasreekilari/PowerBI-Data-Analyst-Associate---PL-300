* Diagnostic Analytics: It answers questions about "Why events happened". KPI's ar einvestigated to discover why events improved or became worse.
* Predictive Analytics: It answers questions about 'What will happen" in the future. Techniques include a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, decision trees and regression.
* Prescriptive Analytics: It answers questions about "which actions should be taken to acheive a goal or target". It relys on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large semantic models.
* Artificial Intelligence: It answers questions about "your data". It supports a wide range of applications, from natural language processing and image recognition to code generation and intelligent visualization suggestions.

Tasks of a data analyst:
* Prepare: Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualize. It is the process of taking raw data and turining it into information that is trusted and understandable. It also invlolves undrstanding how you're going to get and connect to the data and the performance implications of the decisions.
* Model: When the data is in a proper state, it's ready to be modeled. It is the process of determining how your tables are related to each other. It is done by defining and creating realtionships between the tables.
* Visualize: The ultimate goal of visualize task is to solve business problems. An important aspect of visualizing data is designing and creating reports for accessibility. As you build reports, it is important to think about people who will be accesing and reading the reports.
* Analyze: It is important step of understanding and interpreting the information that is dispalyed on the report. As a data analyst, one should understand the analytical capabilities of Power BI and use those capabilities to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes and then communicate those insights in a way that everyone can understand.
* Manage: Power BI consists of many componets, including reports, dashboards, workspaces, semantic models and more. Data anlyst is responsible for the management of these PowerBI assets, overseeing the sharing and distribution of items such as reports and dashboards, and ensuring the security of Power BI assets.
